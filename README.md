## About

QEndpoint is a highly scalable triple store with full-text and GeoSPARQL support. It can be used as a standalone SPARQL endpoint, or as a dependency.

### Built With

- [Spring](https://spring.io/)
- [RDF-HDT](https://www.rdfhdt.org/)
- [RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the backend/benchmark

- Java 11
- Maven

For the frontend (not mandatory to run the backend)

- Node 14

### Installation

- Clone the QEndpoint from this link: `git clone https://github.com/the-qa-company/qEndpoint.git`
- move to the back-end directory `cd hdt-qs-backend`
- Compile the project using this command: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`

You can use the project as a dependency (replace the version by the latest version)

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.the_qa_company</groupId>
    <artifactId>hdtSparqlEndpoint</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Or you can get the executable jar of the endpoint `target/hdtSparqlEndpoint-VERSION-exec.jar`.

## Usage

### Standalone

You can run the endpoint with this command

```bash
java -Xmx"$JAVA_MAX_MEM" "-Dspring.config.location=application.properties" -jar ENDPOINT_JAR &
```

you can find a template of [the application.properties file in the backend source](hdt-qs-backend/src/main/resources/application-prod.properties)

If you have the HDT file of your graph, you can put it before loading the endpoint in the hdt-store directory (by default `hdt-store/index_dev.hdt`)

If you don't have the HDT, you can upload the dataset to the endpoint by running the command while the endpoint is running

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:1234/api/endpoint/load" -F "file=@mydataset.nt"
```

where `mydataset.nt` is the RDF file to load, you can use all [the formats used by RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/javadoc/latest/org/eclipse/rdf4j/rio/RDFFormat.html).

### As a dependency

```java
// Create a SPARQL repository
SparqlRepository repository = CompiledSail.compiler().compileToSparqlRepository();
// Init the repository
repository.init();

// ...

// Shutdown the repository (better to release resources)
repository.shutDown();
```
